This is a place for offline tasks, jobs that will be scheduled with cron daemon. You need to imlement offline:build rake task in your bundle Rakefile to prepare your jobs and put them to offline/build. E.g. if your offline task is a java tool, implement oflline:build to compile and create a jar archive and move it to offline/build directory. The contents of the offline/build directory will be copied to the master job repository at deploy time and your job will be scheduled using the schedule.rb configuration. When you are scheduling your job in schedule.rb, use paths relative to offline/build.

See http://github.com/javan/whenever for information how to configure schedule.rb
